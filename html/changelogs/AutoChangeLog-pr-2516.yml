changes:
  - bugfix: FTL Pylons are now not doomed to run out of nucleium even when supplied.
  - bugfix: FTL Pylons with closed shielding now actually have an increasing nucleium
      demand..
  - tweak: FTL Pylons need multiple cycles of failed power to shut down (to prevent
      power code oddities)
  - balance: FTL Pylons now also output plasma when they are running, instead of only
      when booting (why did they not?)
  - code_imp: Improves various other bits and pieces of code related to FTL Pylons
      that do not need individual mention
