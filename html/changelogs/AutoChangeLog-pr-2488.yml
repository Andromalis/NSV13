changes:
  - rscadd: All non-ghost role antagonist preferences are now per-character. Global
      toggle buttons toggle the preference on all characters at once.
  - refactor: Rewrote antag preference internals to allow for better control of antag
      preferences and more distinct usages.
  - refactor: Cleaned up antag bans, with more distinct settings and new general categories.
  - tweak: All antag prefs will start on by default rather than off. The same applies
      to newly added ones.
  - bugfix: Fixed various antag bans being bypassable.
  - bugfix: Fixed various ghost polls using the wrong preference or ban types.
  - rscdel: Removed BYOND account age checks from antag roles in favor of living hours.
  - rscdel: Removed "Midround Antagonist" preference in favor of unique preferences
      per midround.
  - rscadd: Added distinct role preferences for Antagonists (Roundstart/Latejoin)
      and Midrounds (Ghost/Living).
  - rscadd: Almost all ghost antagonist polls have a "Never for this round" option
      now.
  - rscdel: Removed the ghost notification preferences menu (poll ignore menu).
  - tweak: The lavaland beach bartender can now speak Stoner.
  - rscdel: Removed some unused mob spawners from the code.
  - rscadd: Added 4hr playtime checks to roundstart/latejoin antag roles. Wizard and
      nukeops are 8hr.
  - bugfix: Fixed a typo in the skeleton spawner description.
  - bugfix: Fixed unnecessary DB queries due to is_banned_from not properly ckey-ifying
      the ckey parameter and causing cache misses.
